# Machine-Learning-for-Asset-Managers

Implementation of code snippets and exercises from [Machine Learning for Asset Managers (Elements in Quantitative Finance)](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Managers-Elements-Quantitative/dp/1108792898)
written by Prof. Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado.

The project is for my own learning. If you want to use the consepts from the book - you should head over to Hudson & Thames. They have implemented these consepts and many more in [mlfinlab](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab)

## Chapter 2 Denoising and Detoning

Denoising a random matrix with signal using the constant residual eigenvalue method. This is done by fixing random eigenvalues. See code snippet 2.5

Detoned covariance matrix can be used to calculate minimum variance portfolio. The efficient frontier is the upper portion of the minimum variance frontier starting at the minimum variance portfolio. A denoised covariance matrix is less unstable to change.

## Chapter 3 Distance Metrics

 h<sub>&theta;</sub>(x) = &theta;<sub>o</sub> x + &theta;<sub>1</sub>x
* definition of a metric: 
   1. identity of indiscernibles d(x,y) = 0 => x=y 
   2. Symmetry d(x,y) = d(y,x) 
   3. triangle inequality. 
   - 1,2,3 => non-negativ, d(x,y) >= 0 
* pearson correlation
* distance correlation
* angular distance
* Information-theoretic codependence/entropy dependence
    - cross-entropy
    - Kullback-Leilbler divergence
    - Mutual information
    - variation of information
