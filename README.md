# Machine-Learning-for-Asset-Managers

Implementation of code snippets and exercises from [Machine Learning for Asset Managers (Elements in Quantitative Finance)](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Managers-Elements-Quantitative/dp/1108792898)
written by Prof. Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado.

The project is for my own learning. If you want to use the consepts from the book - you should head over to Hudson & Thames. They have implemented these consepts and many more in [mlfinlab](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab). Edit: seems like some of theyr work - like jupyter notebooks - has gone behind a paywall - doh.

## Chapter 2 Denoising and Detoning

Denoising a random matrix with signal using the constant residual eigenvalue method. This is done by fixing random eigenvalues. See code snippet 2.5

Detoned covariance matrix can be used to calculate minimum variance portfolio. The efficient frontier is the upper portion of the minimum variance frontier starting at the minimum variance portfolio. A denoised covariance matrix is less unstable to change.

## Chapter 3 Distance Metrics

* definition of a metric: 
   1. identity of indiscernibles d(x,y) = 0 => x=y 
   2. Symmetry d(x,y) = d(y,x) 
   3. triangle inequality. 
   - 1,2,3 => non-negativ, d(x,y) >= 0 
* pearson correlation
* distance correlation
* angular distance
* Information-theoretic codependence/entropy dependence
    - cross-entropy:  H[X] = - &Sigma;<sub>s &isin; S<sub>X</sub></sub> p[x] log (p[x])
    - Kullback-Leilbler divergence:  D<sub>KL</sub>[p||q] = - &Sigma;<sub>s &isin; S<sub>X</sub></sub> p[x] log (q[x]/p[x]) = p[x] &Sigma;<sub>s &isin; S</sub> log (p[x]/q[x])
    - Cross-entropy: H<sub>c</sub>[p||q] = H[x] = D<sub>KL</sub>[p||q]
    - Mutual information: Decrease in uncertainty in X from knowing Y: I[X,Y] = H[X] - H[X|Y] = H[X] + H[Y] - H[X,Y] = E<sub>X</sub>[D<sub>KL</sub>[p[y|x]||p[y]]]
    - variation of information: VI[X,Y] = H[X|Y] + H[Y|X] = H[X,Y] - I[X,Y]. It is uncertainty we expect in one variable given another variable: VI[X,Y] = 0 <=> X=Y
    - Kullback-Leilbler divergence is not a metric while variation of information is.

1. 1 bit of information in coin toss
2. 0 bit of information in deterministic outcome
3. less than 1 bit of information in unfair coin toss


* Angular distance: p_d = sqrt(1/2 - (1-rho(X, Y)))
* Absolute angular distance: p_d = sqrt(1/2 - (1-|rho|(X, Y)))
* Squared angular distance: p_d = sqrt(1/2 - (1-rho^2(X, Y)))

Standard angular distance is better used for long-only portfolio appliacations. Squared and Absolute Angular Distances for long-short portfolios. 

## Chapter 4 Optimal Clustering

Use unsupervised learning to maximize intragroup similarities and minimize intergroup similarities. Consider matrix X of shape N x F. N objects and F features. Features are used to compute proximity(correlation, mutual information) to N objects in an NxN matrix.

There are 2 types of clustering algorithms. Partitional and hierarchical:
1. Connectivity: hierarchical clustering
2. Centroids: like k-means
3. Distribution: gaussians
4. Density: search for connected dense regions like DBSCAN, OPTICS
5. Subspace: modeled on two dimension, feature and observation. [Example](https://quantdare.com/biclustering-time-series/)


Generating of random block correlation matrices is used to simulate instruments with correlation. The utility for doing this is in code snippet 4.3, and it uses clustering algorithms <i>optimal number of cluster</i> (ONC) defined in snippet 4.1 and 4.2, which does not need a predefined number of clusters (unlike k-means), but uses an 'elbow method' to stop adding clusters. The optimal number of clusters are achived when there is high intra-cluster correlation and low inter-cluster correlation. The [silhouette score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)) is used to minimize within-group distance and maximize between-group distance.

## Chapter 5 Financial Labels

* Fixed-Horizon method
* Time-bar method
* Volume-bar method

Tiple-Barrier Method involves holding a possition until
1. Unrealized profit target achieved
2. unrealized loss limit reached
3. Position is held beyond a maximum number of bars

Trend-scanning method: the idea is to identify trends and let them run for as long and as far as they may persists, without setting any barriers.

## Chapter 6 Feature Importance Analysis

<i>"p-value does not measure the probability that neither the null nor the alternative hypothesis is true, or the significance of a result."</i>
